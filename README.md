# Project Title

Basic Jenkins for developers.

## Description

This project provides a basic setup for Jenkins, a popular open-source automation server that enables developers to build, test, and deploy their software. 

Jenkins is widely used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) of projects. With this setup, developers can automate their build and deployment processes, making it easier to integrate changes to the project and deploy the project for testing and use.

This setup is designed to be easy to use, even for developers who are new to Jenkins.
